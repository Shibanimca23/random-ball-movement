This web application showcases a basic animation of bouncing balls within a defined container. Each ball has its own color, initial position, and velocity, making the animation visually interesting.

steps to run this program

step 1:Clone this repository to your local machine

step 2:Open the index.html file in a web browser.

You can modify the number of balls created by editing the create(n) function in the script section of the HTML file.
Experiment with different values, colors, and velocities to customize the animation.


Future Enhancement:
Random Acceleration: Introduce random acceleration to the balls, causing their speeds to change slightly over time, adding more unpredictability to the animation.

Elastic Container: Make the container boundaries elastic, so when a ball hits the edge, it stretches or compresses briefly before bouncing back, creating a playful effect.

Random Container Shape: Instead of a rectangular container, randomly select different container shapes (circle, triangle, etc.) for each animation session, adding visual variety.
